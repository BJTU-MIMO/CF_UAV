%INPUT:
%dvec = Vector of arbitrarily length containing distances (in meters)
%       between UEs and APs
%
%OUTPUT:
%PL   = Pathloss without shadowing, for each of the elements of dvec


%Set distances in the three-slope model
d0 = 10; %meter
d1 = 50; %meter

%Constant term in the model from (53) in [15]
L = 140.7151;

%Compute the pathloss using the three-slope model in (52) in [15]
PL = zeros(length(dvec),1);

    if d<=d0
        PL(ind) = -L -15*log10(d1/1000) -20*log10(d0/1000);
